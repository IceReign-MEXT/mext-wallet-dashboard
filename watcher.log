Payment watcher started
(node:21260) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///data/data/com.termux/files/home/mext-wallet-dashboard/icegods-dashboard/scripts/payment_watcher.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /data/data/com.termux/files/home/mext-wallet-dashboard/icegods-dashboard/package.json.
